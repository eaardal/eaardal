## Hi there 👋

*I am a fullstack developer that enjoy making software that solves problems for users. I believe that understanding the full vertical of the software solution make it easier to see the whole user experience and thereby better understand the end delivery.*

🚧 My GitHub repositories are a bit all over the place: Some are working tools, some are incomplete, some are temp projects, some are really really old outdated projects. Most projects are really small and solves some developer friction I had.

🎁 I'm not looking to run any of my projects as OpenSource or public, "real" projects, but if I have made something public, you can always copy and use that code as you see fit.

📫 **Check out [Apparat](https://github.com/apparatno/company) where I work! Yes, we have our company stuff open on GitHub because we believe in openness and transparency! We're also looking for developers in Bergen, Norway!**
