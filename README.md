## Hi there 👋

*I am a fullstack developer that enjoy making software that solves problems for users. I believe that understanding the full vertical of the software solution make it easier to see the whole user experience and understand the end delivery.*

👴 Started in the .NET/C# world back in 2012 where I worked with more or less all their products: ASP.NET WebForms, ASP.NET MVC, WPF, WinForms, Silverlight, Universal App.

🌱 Since 2018 I've been using Go for my backend needs and utility/cli tools, although I'm always looking into something new. Currently trying to learn Rust here and there.

🌱 On the frontend I've worked with React since 2016 and have shipped some smaller websites in Vue and Svelte. I also have a couple of Flutter projects going on.

🚧 My GitHub repositories are a bit all over the place: Some are incomplete, some are temp projects, some are really old outdated projects.

🎁 I'm not looking to run any of my projects as OpenSource or public, "real" projects, but if I have made something public, you can always copy and use that code as you see fit.

📫 **Check out [Apparat](https://github.com/apparatno/company) where I work! Yes, we have our company stuff open on GitHub because we believe in openness and transparency! We're also looking for developers in Bergen, Norway!**
